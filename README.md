### Hi there I am Mohammad Saleh


## Software Developer from Iran

I am a programmer living in Iran. I am very interested in learning new things and developing my ideas. I like high level languages and I always read about them.

Currently, programming is not my job and I have not even learned it academically. Programming is a great pastime for me and I learned it step by step from the internet.

### What languages do I understand?
